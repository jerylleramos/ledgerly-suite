# My Next.js Learning Project – App Router Dashboard - Ledgerly Suite

This project is part of my personal journey to learn and master **Next.js**, specifically using the **App Router**. I'm using this as a hands-on exercise to build a real-world dashboard while exploring core concepts in modern full-stack development.

## ✅ What's Done So Far

The following features and concepts from the official [Next.js Dashboard App tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) have been implemented:

- 🔧 **Project Setup** with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS  
- 📁 **App Router Fundamentals** (Layouts, Pages, and Nested Routes)  
- 🧱 **Shared Layouts and Templates**  
- 🧭 **Dynamic Routes & Route Segments**  
- 📄 **Metadata Handling** (e.g. `generateMetadata`)  
- 🌐 **Loading UI** and **Error Handling** via `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx`  
- 🔐 **Authentication** using credentials-based login with hashed passwords  
- 🧠 **Middleware** for protecting routes and handling sessions  
- 📊 **Dashboard UI** with navigation and breadcrumbs  
- 🌍 **Fetching Data** from a PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM  
- 🛠️ **Server Actions** for handling form submissions  
- 🧾 **Invoices Module** with create, read, update, and delete functionality  
- 📦 **PostgreSQL & Prisma Setup** with schema migrations

## 🚧 What's Next

I’ll be building the **Customers** module next — which will include:

- Customer listing with pagination and search  
- Viewing individual customer details  
- Creating and updating customer data

- 📦 **Products Management**  
- 📋 **Orders & Transactions Module**  
- 📈 **Analytics Dashboard with charts**  
- 🧪 **Unit & Integration Testing** (Jest, React Testing Library)  
- 🔒 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- ⚡ **Optimistic UI Updates**  
- 🌗 **Dark Mode / Theme Switching**  
- 🌐 **API Routes / Server Actions Enhancements**
