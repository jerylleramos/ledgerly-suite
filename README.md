# My Next.js Learning Project – App Router Dashboard - Ledgerly Suite

This project is part of my personal journey to learn and master **Next.js**, specifically using the **App Router**. I'm using this as a hands-on exercise to build a real-world dashboard while exploring core concepts in modern full-stack development.

## ✅ What's Done So Far

The following features and concepts from the official [Next.js Dashboard App tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) have been implemented:

- 🔧 **Project Setup** with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS  
- 📁 **App Router Fundamentals** (Layouts, Pages, and Nested Routes)  
- 🧱 **Shared Layouts and Templates**  
- 🧭 **Dynamic Routes & Route Segments**  
- 📄 **Metadata Handling** (e.g. `generateMetadata`)  
- 🌐 **Loading UI** and **Error Handling** via `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx`  
- 🔐 **Authentication** using credentials-based login with hashed passwords  
- 🧠 **Middleware** for protecting routes and handling sessions  
- 📊 **Dashboard UI** with navigation and breadcrumbs  
- 🌍 **Fetching Data** from a PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM  
- 🛠️ **Server Actions** for handling form submissions  
- 🧾 **Invoices Module** with create, read, update, and delete functionality  
- 📦 **PostgreSQL & Prisma Setup** with schema migrations  
- 👥 **Customers Module** with listing, details, and CRUD operations  
- 🛒 **Items Module** for managing product inventory

## 🤔 What Do You Think Is Next?

The next best module/update would be to implement **Orders & Transactions**, connecting customers and items, and enabling end-to-end workflow for the dashboard.

- 🧪 **Unit & Integration Testing** (Jest, React Testing Library)  
- 🔒 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- ⚡ **Optimistic UI Updates**  
- 🌗 **Dark Mode / Theme Switching**  
- 🌐 **API Routes / Server Actions Enhancements**  
- 🧹 **Form Validation & Error UX Improvements**  
- 🛍️ **Advanced Items Management** (categories, stock tracking)  
- 📝 **Order History & Transaction Reports**  

Feel free to suggest more features that can help improve the project or expand my learning!
